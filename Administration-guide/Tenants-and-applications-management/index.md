This guide explains how to manage develop applications in Kaa Admin UI and how to work with Avro UI forms.

This guide also explains how to use _Avro UI forms GWT Sandbox_, which is a testing environment for Avro UI forms.

This guide assumes that Kaa has already been installed and Admin UI is available from the web. If it's not the case, look at the [Installation guide]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Getting-started/#installation) for more info.

# First registration

The first time you log in to Kaa Admin UI, it is required that you register as a [Kaa admin](#kaa-admin).

<img src="attach/image2015-5-28%2017-7-0.png" width="400" height="270">

# Kaa user types

The following three user types are available in Kaa :

- Kaa admin
- Tenant admin
- Tenant developer

**NOTE**
In Kaa Sandbox, [default credentials]({{root_url}}Getting-started/#administration-ui) are provided for all three types of Kaa users.

# Kaa admin

The _Kaa admin_ is the highest level administrator of Kaa. He is able to create, edit, and delete tenant admins.
To log into the Kaa UI as a Kaa admin, use the previously created username/password for the Kaa admin.

![](attach/image2014-12-22%2016-22-58.png)

To customize the account, click **Settings => Profile** in the upper right corner of the window and change the first/last name and e-mail to the private ones. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
Note that **Email** is a mandatory field.

<img src="attach/image2014-11-12%2013-3-23.png" width="600" height="400">

To set a private password, click **Settings => Change password** and fill in the fields as required.

![](attach/image2014-11-10%2017-31-31.png)

## Configuring general settings

The **General settings** window allows you to configure the application title and application base URL parameters. These parameters are used for sending email notifications to registered users.
To customize the general settings, click **Settings => General** settings and fill in the fields as required.

<img src="attach/image2015-5-28%2017-22-54.png" width="700" height="350">

## Configuring outgoing mail settings

Outgoing mail settings are used to send emails to newly created users with the information about their passwords, as well as for sending other notifications.
To customize the outgoing mail settings, click **Settings => Outgoing mail settings** and fill in the fields according to your SMTP mail server configuration.

<img src="attach/image2015-5-28%2017-26-57.png" width="600" height="400">

## Managing System CTL

The **System CTL** window displays a list of CTs with system scope. A Kaa admin can add new system CTs and delete system CTs from the system.

<img src="attach/System%20CTL.png" width="700" height="250">

To create a new system CT, click **Add new type** and then fill in all the required fields. Click **Add** to apply the changes.

<img src="attach/Create%20System%20CTL.png" width="700" height="350">

To view a system CT, open the CT details window by clicking the row in the list in the **System CTL** window.

<img src="attach/View%20System%20CTL.png" width="700" height="380">

To view another version of the system CT, click on the version drop-down and select the appropriate version.

To create a new version of the system CT of the same FQN, click **Create new version** on the top of CT details.

To export the system CT, click **Export** and select export method from drop-down. See [CT schema export support999](999) for available export methods details.

To delete the system CT version, click **Delete** on the top of the CT details.

## Managing Tenants

The Kaa IoT platform supports Multi-tenant architecture. It allows _Kaa admin_ to create separate scope for each instance of Tenant.
Unlike _Kaa admin_, entities like _Tenant Admin_ and _Tenant Developer_ can be visible only in the scope of single Tenant.
For more information about Multitenancy, check related description on [wiki]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy ).

"_Need image that describes Kaa multi-tenant architecture_"

To learn how to manage _Tenants_ and _Tenant Admins_, check: [Users management]({{root_url}}Administration-guide/Users-management)

# Tenant admin

The _tenant admin_ is a Kaa user who is responsible for managing applications, users and event class families.
To log into the Admin UI as a tenant admin, use the previously generated username/password for the tenant admin.
To customize the account, click **Settings => Profile** and change the first/last name and e-mail to private ones.
To set a private password, click **Settings => Change password** and fill in the fields as required.

## Managing applications

As a tenant admin, you can add and edit applications.

To create a new application, do the following:

1. Open the **Applications** window by clicking the corresponding link on the navigation panel.

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-4%2016-47-22.png" width="400" height="250">

2. Click **Add application** at the top of the window.
3. Enter the title of your application and then click **Add**.

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-4%2016-48-49.png" width="500" height="250">

**NOTE:** If you open the **Application details** window of the newly created application (by clicking this application on either the **Applications** menu on the navigation panel or the **Applications** window), you will notice that the **Application Token** field has been filled in automatically. This is a unique auto-generated application ID.

To edit the application, open the **Application details** window by clicking the application name either on the navigation panel or in the list in the **Applications** window.

## Managing event class families

To use the Kaa [events feature999](999) for one or more applications, the tenant admin should create an event class family (ECF). Each ECF should be described using the [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html) format.

To create a new ECF, do the following:

1. Open the **Event class families** window by clicking the corresponding link on the navigation panel.
2. In the **Event class families** window, click **Add ECF**.

   <img src="attach/image2015-3-4%2016-58-15.png" width="850" height="220">

3. In the **Add ECF** window, fill in all the required fields and then click **Add**.
**NOTE:** the namespace and class name values should be unique.

   <img src="attach/image2015-3-4%2017-1-19.png" width="500" height="370">

4. In the **Event class families** window, add (optionally) an ECF schema by clicking **Add schema** under the **Schemas** table.

   <img src="attach/image2015-3-4%2017-2-28.png" width="500" height="400">

5. In the **Add event class family schema** window, create an ECF schema either by using the **Event class family schema** [schema form](#schema-form) or by uploading the schema from a file, then click Add.
**NOTE:** More than one schema can be added to an ECF.
**NOTE:** If uploaded from a file, a schema(s) should be written in the [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html) format and describe how event classes should be grouped depending on subject areas.

   <img src="attach/image2015-3-2%2014-54-7.png" width="500" height="400">

A unique version number is assigned to a schema after its creation and then the schema appears as a clickable line in the **Schemas** table. To review the ECF schema details, click the appropriate schema line in the **Schemas** table. Each schema automatically splits into event classes. A full qualifier name, schema and type are shown for each event class in the table with the same name.

<img src="attach/image2015-3-4 17-8-26.png" width="500" height="400">

## Managing Tenant CTL

The **Tenant CTL** window displays a list of CTs with tenant and system scope. The tenant admin can add new tenant CTs and delete tenant CTs from the system. It has read-only access to the system CTs.

<img src="attach/Tenant%20CTL.png" width="800" height="300">

To display/hide higher scopes of CTs, check/uncheck **Display higher scopes** checkbox.
To create a new tenant CT, click **Add new type** and then fill in all the required fields. Click **Add** to apply the changes.

<img src="attach/Create%20Tenant%20CTL.png" width="700" height="350">

To view a CT, open the CT details window by clicking the row in the list in the **Tenant CTL** window.

<img src="attach/View%20Tenant%20CTL.png" width="700" height="350">

To view another version of the CT, click on the version drop-down and select the appropriate version.
To create a new version of the tenant CT of the same FQN, click **Create new version** on the top of CT details.
To export the CT, click Export and select export method from drop-down. See [CT schema export support999](999) for available export methods details.
To delete the tenant CT version, click Delete on the top of the CT details.

# Tenant developer

The tenant developer is a user that creates SDKs based on customer requirements. Tenant developers set the Kaa schemas, group endpoints, and control notification processes.

To log into the Kaa UI as a tenant developer, use the previously generated credentials for the tenant developer.

To customize this account, click **Settings => Profile** and change the first/last name and e-mail to private ones.

To set a private password, click **Settings => Change password**.

**NOTE:** A tenant developer is able to work only with those applications which have been created by his tenant admin. The list of available applications is displayed in the **Applications** window, as well as on the navigation panel under the **Applications** menu.

## SDK profiles

Each SDK instance in Kaa is based on the SDK profile – a template which is used to generate SDK instances for different target platforms. This template must be created by the tenant developer as the first step of the application development process.

### Viewing SDK profiles

To view a list of the SDK profiles already created for the application, open the **SDK profiles** window either from the navigation panel or by clicking **Generate SDK** in the application view.

<img src="attach/list.png" width="800" height="500">

To view some SDK profile in detail, open the **SDK profile** window by clicking on the profile from the list.

<img src="attach/details.png" width="600" height="300">

### Creating SDK profiles

To create an SDK profile for the application, do the following:

1. Select the application under the **Applications** menu on the navigation panel.
2. In the **Application details** window, click **Generate SDK**.
3. In the **SDK profiles** window, click **Add SDK profile**.
4. In the **Add SDK profile** window, provide a name and select schema versions for the SDK profile.
5. To use the Kaa event feature, add one or more event class families and specify a user verifier.
6. Click **Add** at the top of the window to finish creating the SDK profile.

   <img src="attach/SDK.png" width="700" height="430">

Once created, the SDK profile cannot be changed. However, unused or erroneous SDK profiles can be deleted by clicking on the **Delete** icon.

**NOTE**
The SDK profile in use cannot be deleted. An attempt to delete the SDK profile that has endpoint profiles associated with it will fail and result in an error.

### SDK token

Each SDK profile has a unique _SDK token_ associated with it. These tokens are generated from the SDK profile's raw data using [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) algorithm and then encoded in URL-safe [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).

### Generating endpoint SDK

To generate the SDK instance from the **SDK profile**, open the SDK profiles window, then click on the **Generate SDK** icon next to the selected SDK profile, select the target platform, and click **Generate SDK**.

![](attach/Generating.png)

The resulting file will contain the appropriate SDK token as a part of its name.

## Adding shemas

In Kaa, an SDK for an application is generated based on the following five schemas: client-side endpoint profile, server-side endpoint profile, configuration, notification, and log. Every application has default schemas, which can be accessed from the **Schema** submenu in the corresponding application menu on the navigation panel.

### Client-side endpoint profile schema

The list of client-side endpoint profile schemas created by a tenant developer for the application is shown in the **Client-side EP profile schemas** window, which can be opened from the application menu on the navigation panel as illustrated by the following screenshot.

# Avro UI Forms

Avro UI forms are GUI components in the Admin UI that allow you to create Kaa schemas and enter corresponding data records without using the [Avro/JSON](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html) syntax.

## Avro UI form types

There are two Avro UI form types: a _schema form_ and a _record form_.

### Schema form

A schema form allows the user (tenant developer) to create Kaa schemas (profile, configuration, notification, and log schemas) for applications in Admin UI.

It consists of a header with the general schema info, such as the name, namespace, and display name, and the **Fields** section where you can add fields to your schema.

**NOTE**  
You can also upload a schema from a file using the **Upload from file** option. In this case, the schema must be provided in the JSON format.

<img src="attach/image2015-3-4 13-58-15.png" width="600" height="400">

### Record form

A record form allows the user (tenant developer) to enter data records according to corresponding Kaa schemas (configuration and notification schemas) for applications in Admin UI.

A record form contains the fields according to the corresponding schema.

**NOTE**  
You can also upload data from a file using the **Upload from file** option. In this case, the data must be provided in the JSON format.

<img src="attach/image2015-3-3 16-39-51.png" width="500" height="400">

## Working with schema form

An example of a schema form usage is creating a new configuration schema.

1.  Open the **Configuration schemas** window for some application in Admin UI and then click **Add schema**.
2.  In the **Configuration schema** schema form, specify the name, namespace, and display name of the record.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 17-39-10.png" width="700" height="400">

3.  To add a new field, click **Add** in the **Fields** section in the form.
4.  On the **Add new Field** page of the form, specify the field parameters as required and select the field type.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 17-49-38.png" width="700" height="400">

5.  Depending on the selected field type, specify additional parameters for the field.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 17-52-16.png" width="700" height="400">

6.  Click **Add** to finish adding the field.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 18-3-40.png" width="700" height="400">

7.  In a similar way, add as many fields as necessary and then save the schema (see [Adding schemas section](#adding-shemas) for details).

## Working with record form

An example of a record form usage is adding new configuration data to an endpoint group.

1.  Open the **Endpoint groups** window for some application in Admin UI and click on some endpoint group.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 18-24-37.png" width="600" height="250">

2.  Scroll down to the **Configurations** form and then click **Add configuration**.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 19-20-39.png" width="600" height="250">

3.  Specify the field values in the **Configuration body** record form and then click **Save** to save the configuration.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-3 19-29-20.png" width="600" height="450">

4.  To apply the new configuration, click **Activate**.

## Avro UI forms GWT Sandbox

_Avro UI forms GWT Sandbox_ is a tool for testing Avro UI forms. It allows you to create an Avro schema using the schema form (or adding a schema in the Avro format) and see what the corresponding record form will look like.

To start using this tool, [install and run Kaa Sandbox](http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Kaa+Sandbox#KaaSandbox-InstallingSandbox) at first and then go to the following URL (by default): [http://127.0.0.1:9080/avroUiSandbox/](http://127.0.0.1:9080/avroUiSandbox/).

<img src="attach/image2015-3-4 14-10-1.png" width="800" height="450">

To generate an Avro UI record form, proceed as follows:

1.  Create an Avro schema in the schema form or, alternatively, click **Upload from JSON** and paste your schema into the text field.
2.  Click **Generate form**.  

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-4 15-35-10.png" width="600" height="300">

3.  (Optional) To view the generated schema in the JSON format, click **Show JSON** under the schema form.

    <img src="attach/image2015-3-4 15-37-15.png" width="500" height="450">

To view the JSON record for the data from the record form, enter some data into the field(s) and click **Show JSON**.

<img src="attach/image2015-3-4 15-44-42.png" width="500" height="480">

To upload data from the JSON record into the record form, click **Upload from JSON**, then enter the data into the text field in the JSON format and click **Upload**.

<img src="attach/image2015-3-4 15-48-16.png" width="400" height="400">

## Avro schema parameters

If the Avro schema is added in the JSON format rather than via GUI, the following parameters of the schema determine the layout and values displayed on the Avro UI record form.

*   displayName - displays the name of the field on UI
*   displayNames - displays the name of each enumeration symbol on UI (only for enumeration fields in the schema)
*   displayPrompt - displays the text prompt for the field on UI
*   by_default - displays the default value of the field on UI
*   minRowCount - defines a minimum number of rows in a UI table (only for arrays in the schema)
*   optional - defines whether the field on UI is optional or mandatory
*   weight - defines a relative width of the corresponding column on UI (only for arrays in the schema)
*   keyIndex - defines the order in which the fields of a record are displayed in a row (only for arrays of records in the schema; integer; if this parameter is defined selectively for specific fields of the record, the other fields of the record will not be displayed)
*   overrideStrategy - defines [how to merge arrays in the configuration across the endpoint groups999](999) (only for arrays in the schema; accepted values are "replace" and "append"; "replace" by default)
*   fieldAccess - defines the viewing and editing restrictions for the field (accepted values are "read_only", "editable" and "hidden"; "editable" by default)
*   inputType - defines whether the characters will be masked or not when the user enters the field value (accepted values are "password" and "plain"; "plain" by default)
